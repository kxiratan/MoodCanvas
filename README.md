# MoodCanvas
An emotion-aware, multisensory collaborative whiteboard that transforms your stand-ups into immersive, emotionally intelligent experiences through AI-powered emotion analysis, dynamic mood-based color themes, and adaptive soundscapes. Don't just make stand-ups communicate what teams say, but how they feel.

## Overview
MoodCanvas is a standalone web application that reimagines the way teams share ideas by adding emotional intelligence to your meetings. From daily stand-ups to creative brainstorms, the platform automatically detects the emotional tone of discussions and reates an atmosphere that matches through color themes, music, and visuals.

Unlike traditional collaborative whiteboards, MoodCanvas helps teams read between the lines, helping leaders and cross-teams sense emotional alignment, uncover hidden concerns, and be completely transparent between every individual's project sentiment.
